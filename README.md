# gentoo-overlay
This is my personal gentoo overlay for temporary fixes and selfmad ebuilds.

## Custom profile
As gentoo does not provide a systemd desktop profile without useflags for a desktop environment I made a new profile:
> doofy:default/linux/amd64/13.0/desktop/systemd

Show available profiles:
> eselect profile list
